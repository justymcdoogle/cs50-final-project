# Guitar50

#### Description:
Guitar50 is my 2050 CS50 Final Project. The idea for this concept as my final project came about after I was frequently frustrated with the existing guitar tab viewers/makers online. Often these tabs and chords were being misaligned, formatted weirdly, or just plain ugly. In addition to the tabs themselves, I found that upon starting many of the available existing mobile apps, I am often bombarded with many, many pop-up ads. This became such a problem that a personal vendetta was formed after realizing that there aren't really any GOOD free guitar tabs.

This is what Guitar50 seeks to solve, by providing a clean, ad-free environment and a more structured editor that enforces a standard for guitar tabs/chords and lyrics. So by organizing the songs into distinct sections, I can (hopefully) get more readable, organized, and professional guitar tabs. Plus, I just also think it would be cool to have my own guitar app :)

##### Design choices:
I decided to focus mainly on the "create" screen, since I felt like that was half the issue (the other being the ads, which I just... automatically solved by not doing anything). I saw how other guitar tab makers do their creation process, and I just wasn't very satisfied. I mean, a giant text box where people basically don't have to follow at all the formatting of a traditional guitar tab? Ah, so THIS is why we have so many bad tabs that are *somehow* approved! Surely this can be solved. So I decided to make it straightforward, structured, and organized. Make each section one at a time, each being automatically named and tracked depending on what kind of type the section is, and keep everything nice and tidy. The heart of the app's design is at this "section" part. Each section holds information about itself (organized into a semi-complicated dictionary on the back-end) and each section can also spawn more and more lines within themselves. This section-ing of the chords/lyrics really helps to visualize and keep things much more nice looking in the end.

##### Pages:
This web app has 7 pages plus one overall layout. The 7 pages are: Register, Login, Home (Index), Search, Create tab, Favorites, Song. Most of these are pretty self explanatory. Song displays songs (dynamic URL, based on it's id), search queries the database (tabs.db). Create tab is definitely the most involved one. It took a ton of work to get that one working, from the display of the different "<div>"s to the css classes to the huge blocks of JavaScript just to copy (or delete) one part over and over. It was fun, but also.. a lot.

##### Database schema:
My project uses three tables in one tabs.db file. The first table, called 'users', and holds unique ids, usernames, and hashed passwords of users. The next table is called 'tabs', and it too has unique ids. It also holds name (title), artist name, user_id (author/creator of the tab), content (the entire tab/chords/lyrics themselves), and a timestamp of creation. The final table is a kind of join table. This table is called favorites, and it's sole purpose is just to keep track of which user has favorited which song (uniquely). So we just 'INSERT' a new favorite into the database whenever someone presses the heart 'favorite' button on the song page. This way we can easily connect the user with their individual favorite songs.

##### Most fun part to make:
Definitely the best part for me, personally was the create tab feature. It actually was super interesting to parse through the data that was collected from my front-end and break it down into chunks that were usable in the back-end. Not only the parsing, but also building the string to be able to be stored properly into the 'content' section of the database. Very cool to see this come together and actually work without too many major bugfixing involved (relatively).

##### AI Usage:
The most AI I used was for the JavaScript (mainly in create tab) and the css. JavaScript kind of confuses me still (lol), and I just don't have a great grasp on class inheritance and I haven't spent enough time with BootStrap to be able to create a really fancy-looking custom style. Especially the JavaScript for creating new lines and new sections in the tab creation, I think it would've been a nightmare to try and attempt to do that myself. I started to understand a bit more about JavaScript FROM the stuff that I got from AI's (I used mainly Claude), so at least I do feel like, to a certain extent, I do understand the code that is inside this project.

##### Future Improvements:
I'd like to do a few improvements in the future, one of which is the centering of the create page. If you shrink the page enough, you'll see that the "Delete Section" button will overlap with the section type dropdown. It also does not stay centered. I didn't realize this until the very end, so that's what I would likely fix first.
The next thing is probably more options for the dropdown menu, like "Pre-Chorus" or "Interlude" or "Instrumental", some of these more edge-case names for specific things in songs.
